We are the Texas A&M Surface Processes research group at Texas A&M University, led by Dr. Andrew Moodie and in the Department of Geography.

If you are interested in working in our research group at Texas A&M, please <a href="/contact/" target="_blank">get in touch via email</a>.

*At TAMU, our research integrates surface process modeling with quantitative geomorphology to build our understanding of landscape change.*
I'm also an educator, committed to bringing technology and research into the classroom.
