## Research group

Every member of our research community deserves to be treated with respect.
Moreover, every person brings value to our community and we are the most successful when we are diverse in experience and background.
An exceptional professional reputation enables a research group to secure funding, complete research, and share findings with the public. 

In light of these important facts, our research group maintains a Code of Conduct that establishes guidelines to achieve a healthy and reputable research community.

## Individuals

I do not believe that there is any single mentoring approach that will work for all students.
We all have individual needs, circumstances, preferences, and backgrounds that must be learned to make a Mentor--Mentee relationship successful.

Establishing a plan for progression of the graduate career with explicit expectations and responsibilities promotes accessibility and equality in academic environments.
I have developed a mentoring plan that I work through with all new graduate students soon after they have associated with the research group.
