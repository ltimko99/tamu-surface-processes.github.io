I am open to supporting applications to a Postdoc Fellowship for external funding, for applicants who are interested in topics relevant to our group.
If you are writing a Postdoc Fellowship proposal and would like to collaborate, please reach out to <a href="mailto:amoodie@tamu.edu">Andrew Moodie</a> by email that includes the following items:
* a brief description of your background and expertise

## Graduate Student Opportunities

**We are recruiting up to two (2) graduate students to begin in Fall 2025.**

We have externally-funded research assistant positions to support Master's and or PhD student research on topics related to dynamics of river and delta systems building into lakes with falling water level.
There are also teaching assistant positions available to support Master's and or PhD student research on meandering and braided river dynamics, and human influence on river and delta evolution.

Graduate students interested in process geomorphology and relevant topics are encouraged to apply for admission to the graduate program.
The Texas A&M Department of Geography has expertise across all disciplines of Geography; please consider which faculty's research interests most closely align with your own before applying.

If you believe your research interests are closely aligned with our ongoing research topics, please reach out to <a href="mailto:amoodie@tamu.edu">Andrew Moodie</a> by email that includes the following items:

## Undergraduate Student Opportunities

We typically have 1--3 undergraduates doing research in the group. 
Undergraduate students will be mentored by PI Moodie and/or a graduate student in the group, depending on the student interest and available projects.
Please note that we typically only bring on undergraduate students that have already taken *GEOG 331: Geomorphology* or another class with PI Moodie.
