  Humans have been modifying delta landscapes for centuries. What are the cumulative impacts of this management and how can we best manage deltas into the future?
---



Hundreds of millions of people live on river deltas around the world, representing a rich diversity in culture and generating thriving economies.
Governments have sought ever more drastic measures to prevent flooding and protect society and its infrastructure on deltas.
But, these policies can harm the natural environment and lead to loss of precious land.


With research in this theme, we aim to understand how human decisions to modify the landscape affect landscape morphodynamics, and what are long-term outcomes for the natural system as a result.
A goal is to identify best practices for the human management of deltaic landscapes, so that both the human and natural systems are sustainable.  
However, this kind of optimization invites choices about what is the "best" outcome and who gets to choose what it means to be the "best"; we are particularly interested in  understanding how we can equitably balance tradeoffs in any management decisions.

We have developed a framework that examines factors impacting delta diversion effectiveness.

  <figcaption>Figure 2: Conceptual summary depicting three potential diversion scenarios. The natural avulsion location ($L_A$) is determined by the region of maximum sedimentation within the delta, near the upstream extent of the backwater length ($L_b$). Diversion (1) cost is low, but does not lower the channel bed at the natural avulsion location, nor increase the time until a natural avulsion, and so it provides very little societal benefit. In contrast, diversion (2) has a moderate cost, but creates an upstream-migrating scour wave that lowers the channel bed in the region of maximum sedimentation, significantly increasing the time to a natural avulsion, and so provides high societal benefit. Diversion (3) bypasses the region of maximum sedimentation entirely, and so it provides high societal benefit, but diversion costs are too high to be justifiable..</figcaption>
