*Our research integrates surface process modeling with quantitative geomorphology to build our understanding of landscape change.*

In particular we focus on fluvial and deltaic environments, which possess an abundance of natural resources that are critical for societal wellbeing. 
We also have research projects that study sediment transport processes and surface evolution in other environments as well, though.
