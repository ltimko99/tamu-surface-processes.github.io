  A limited understanding of subsurface structure inhibits our ability to predict flow patterns and sustainably manage water resources.
---


The dynamics of coastal rivers and deltas create heterogeneous deposits that influence subsurface fluid flow patterns.
Geological heterogeneity strongly influences flow pathways and thus rates of contaminant transport and groundwater aquifer recharge, which limits our ability to sustainably manage water resources and mitigate health risks in river-delta environments.
Spatial scales of subsurface stratigraphic variability in river-deltas ranges from micron-scale pore-space discontinuities to irregularly-shaped sand-bodies that can be tens of meters thick and many kilometers in length. 
Smaller-scale subsurface heterogeneity due to channel and bedform dynamics (<1\~m) is typically under-constrained, because it is below the resolution that can be imaged by geophysical techniques.


In research under this theme, we have used numerical modeling, information theory, and machine learning models to constrain variability in the subsurface, and therefore contribute to societal sustainability on river-deltas.
